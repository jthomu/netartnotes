*Part I*

We often take numbers for granted. historically humans use Arabic numerals (also known as decimal numerals) which are based on a base ten formatting (due to the original amount of numerals 0-9. by reconfiguring the numbers 0-9 of the Arabic numeral system to generate higher quantities. the base of a numerical system may change, in computing we typically use base16 (hexadecimal) and base2 (binary). computer code in its most general sense is another separate numeral system. binary has a base of 2 and goes in order: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. each of these numerals is a bit, and 8 bits equals a byte. This means that each byte has a cap of 255 (often this is how volume/color may be represented by a computer). hexadecimal has a base of 16 which go in order from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. So, despite the changing numerical systems: 255, 11111111, and FF all equal the same value. the fundamental basis of computer coding is that we can represent a value with the voltage of electricity which in turn can be represented by a binary or hexadecimal code. electricity can be stored on discs and this is done in two ways: if one zooms into a cd/dvd there are small valleys and peaks on the surface which in the most abstract way related to the ones and zeros of a binary code. This originated in the punch cards which used to be used for computer programming. The other way is a series of micro-burn marks which is read by a laser. Data storage also falls into two categories. One is volatile storage (electricity stops, one loses the data being stored) and the other is non-volatile storage (electricity stops, one does not lose the data).

The heart of a computer is a CPU (central processing unit) which performs all the data processing, modern computers also have A GPU (graphic processing unit) which changes the values on the screen, however, the GPU is not truly engage (at least by programmers) unless what program is highly. Data is stored in a computer in Ram (volatile) and in a Hard Drive (non-volatile). A Hard Drive stores data by magnetically activating electricity.

*Part III*

As Lev Manovich tells us, all digital artifacts are represented numerically. One of the first ways we did this was through ASCII. ASCII assigns different letters to different numerical values and the highest value in ASCII is 127. Interoperability: wanting computers to easily work together. ASCII is a standardized way of representing the alphabet so that if multiple people are opening the same file, the corresponding binary code will be read in the same way by each differing computer. The modern ASCII (the system of masking numerical values to linguistic symbols) is Unicode.
